# MuteAll-DiscordBot-AmongUs

In among us, there's always some people who don't mute their mics and keeps talking during the game (outside of meeting times) and ruins the game for everyone. It is frustrating and time consuming to mute everyone one by one, so I made this bot that will server mute everyone in a voice chat with a simple command.

  - Type ```.help``` to view all the commands.
  - Type ```.mute``` or ```.m``` to mute everyone in your current voice channel.
    - Both you and the bot require ```Mute Members``` permission. Make sure the bot also has the permission in your current voice channel.
  - Type ```.unmute``` or ```.u``` to unmute everyone in your current voice channel.
    - only the bot requires ```Mute Members``` permission.
