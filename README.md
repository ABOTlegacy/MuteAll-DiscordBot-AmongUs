In among us, there's always some people who don't mute their mics and keeps talking during the game (outside of meeting times) and ruins the game for everyone. It is frustrating and time consuming to mute everyone one by one, so I made this bot that will server mute everyone in a voice chat with a simple command -> .mute or .m | you can also unmute everyone by using .unmute or .u | Type .help to view all the commands with details. To use .mute you will need the "Mute Members" permission and the bot will also need the "Mute Members" permission. Make sure the bot also has "Mute Members" permission in that perticular voice channel. Invite link -> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=757369495953342593&scope=bot&permissions=4201472
